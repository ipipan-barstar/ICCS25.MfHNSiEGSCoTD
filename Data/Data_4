#bbcqt so shall we always applaud a great political leader until they invade iraq or win elections after the falklands we the electorate seem to be motivated by war and seriously misunderstand the day to day stuff like the nhs brexit lies and economics brexit sense

those questioning but @aaronrodgers12 was only a fine note he engaged directly with the #nfl on his immunization theories and was denied an exemption they knew he was unvaxxed but fined for workplace protocols

it is natural for @lewishamilton to speak up on human rights in bahrain because hamilton is british and repression in bahrain was made in the uk bahrain was a british protectorate and al khalifa have been in power with our support since 1820 f1 is not separate from it #r4today
re woman on #bbcqt there have always been people who speak and think like this in the past they kept this kind of talk to their homes friends and fam now not only do they say it in public but on national tv without shame thats how far we have fallen
even john robertson #nffc s greatest player of all time used to put in a decent shift and you know what by comparison carvalho isnt fit to wipe robbos arse now give it a rest
there should be an added and separate stat for receivers piy or pass interference yardage a receiver should get credit for yardage taken away from him because of an interference call but it should not be included in the yardage total qbs too should have a piy stat & dbs #nfl

rest is important to #mentalhealth many of us are used to burning the midnight oil however we have to take time to rest and rejuvenate our mind i used to be that person and i paid the price with my physical and mental health dont do it
self care isnt just drinking water and going to sleep early self care is taking a break when things become overwhelming saying no to things you do not want to do allowing yourself to cry asking for help from those around you doing things that make you happy #mentalhealth

trump is literally spelling out that no matter what happens on nov 3rd if he isnt re-elected he isnt accepting the results this is america #debates2020
if fitz were to take an #nfl hc job i wonder if his first call would be kafka to be his offensive coordinator not saying kafka would take it but id have to imagine thatd be one of the assistants fitz would target
just because trump threatens not to show at #debates2020 doesnt mean debate shouldnt proceed bet if trump is told that it will force his hand he thinks hes in control and is throwing a tantrum if trump doesnt show biden town hall if shows he shows self again win win
going back to this i reckon darren randolph wouldnt be a bad shout as 2nd choice keeper seems the type thats happy to play that role and is a decent keeper #nffc

my takeaway trump won in that he picked up more voters tonight than biden did i dont expect well see a significant 3-5 point shift in polls--but in some swing states where the biden campaign says its closer than polls suggest it could make a difference #debates2020
look i dont know anything but i just find it hard to believe that jalen reagor will be anything more than a solid punt returner and 3rd 4th wr in the #nfl it will end up being a really bad pick legendarily bad pick
the #nfl is fining coaches 100k for not wearing a mask on the sideline but your average entitled karen thinks shes gonna call her lawyer because asking her to wear a mask is anti-constitutional let that sink in

lincoln riley maybe a great offensive mind but he cant bring that caliber of defense to the #nfl if defense wins super bowls why arent more defensive coordinators considered for hc jobs

no one should be alone with their mental health everyone who struggles should have someone to talk to we need to keep repeating important aspects like how it is invisible we can make this happen #mentalhealth
1 doubling the weapon damage and preventing spells from critting is really missing the point everyone is really hyped on the table when a critical happens watching a paladin smite the rogue sneak attacking or even the warlock using eldritch blast and score a crit #dnd

2022 #vote choices 1 the party that removes child safe-guarding and increases the risk of rape for women & girls in formerly all-female spaces 2 the party that forces a woman or raped little girl to use her body as incubator for her rapists offspring even if it kills her

i feel like with #smackdown all were doing is waiting recently first we had to wait for them to go fox then wait for the draft and now waiting to wrap up the shit at crown jewel before they can actually start doing stuff properly hope to see things pick up in november
its up to you the voters #vote for the right people because this is what happened if and when you they didnt the nras in it for the money firstly so are their supporters cos they have that money to turn a blind eye with their thoughts & bloody prayers

why dont we get receipts of our votes thats the biggest fraud about our voting system we should get a receipt with a blockchain code attached where we should be able to verify our vote and that it counted and that it wasnt discarded by a anyone #election2020
i know its super easy to take for granted now that the internet delivers alternative #dnd options to us daily but sitting in a game shop and cracking open the unearthed arcana book for 3 5 was life changing

well said @lucympowell and @yanisvaroufakis on #bbcqt pushing back on the rubbish about taking the knee being divisive and defending gareth southgate its unbelievably depressing that saying such things are now deemed radical

i dont understand why people look for something of substance in these debates when they are structured as 2 minute soundbite opportunities 90 minutes of a more open platform with a looser structure would be far more compelling viewing #debates2020

hes the pm of a nuclear armed state is not as reassuring a statement as some may think to defend a man who apparently couldnt spot a party while attending one and allows the intern to coordinate military operations via email #r4today
rather than rebroadcasting a match that aired less than three months ago this would have been a great opportunity to introduce many fans to what is arguably undertakers greatest match vs michaels from badd blood 97 especially w hbk speaking on the show tonight #smackdown

ladies and gentlemen the reason the ic title match wasnt this sunday at backlash is because it would have outshined the greatest wrestling match ever #smackdown
#bbcqt @bbcquestiontime so all the studio guests dont wear masks and are covid free mixed messages or maybe their not buying into the paranoia but scaremonger and talk second wave
i immensely dislike the dirty birds @ravens & look forward to another loss but surely with so many on the covid list the game should now be postponed #nfl
look dominik mysterio has been doing great on the main roster but the dude has one of the slowest 619s and weakest frog splashes in the game he should make his own signature finisher #smackdown

trump talking about rigged elections as if he hasnt been president for the last four years and could have done anything to make it not rigged #debates2020
the sobering reality for me is that all of the trump supporters dont disappear they go back into the shadows but still providing a sprinkle of oppression wherever they are we cannot act like theyre no longer there because theres a change in administration #election2020
one day at a time set your heart on those things & people you want to happen in your life remember your emotional social and psychological wellbeing is what your #mentalhealth is about which is basically about how you feel and think about yourself think good of yourself

#r4today perhaps professor ferguson has resigned because he didnt want the lady to have her name dragged through the mud as the media are now doing to him he has resigned and apologised so that is an end to it

#bbcqt as left-leaning an audience as to be expected from the bbc first time ive watched since david dimbleby left so good to remember it is not representative of real life

american democracy is so weird like im happy biden won because hes not you know who but at the same time its absolute insanity that two accused rapists ten years past retirement age were presidential candidates #election2020

mustve been a useless #debates2020 on tonight every right leaning account i follow is rejoicing in trump absolutely crushing biden every left leaning account is anointing biden president for putting trump in his place meanwhile not one single american changed their vote
good on @bbcsimonjack for calling out transport secretary @grantshapps palpable brexity bullshit on @bbcr4today just now more of this please @bbcnews @bbcpolitics #r4today
so the main takeaways from #debates2020 trump constantly needs the first and last word only attacks people extremist interrupts constantly lies biden doesnt answer any questions talks to the camera keeps attacking trump instead of sticking to issues america fucked
figueiredo is a big problem for this team was badly positioned all game v swansea and averaging a couple of big mistakes per game not sure what hughton is seeing #nffc

i might be jumping to conclusions but i think trump lost it in these first 20 minutes and i also think joe biden is winning it with each minute and i think hes even winning some of the conservative hard line folks with dismissive commensurate jabs at trump #debates2020
#r4today what are these massive advances in mass testing of which you speak are they a work of fiction like the world beating test track and trace system
us elections in 2020 arent biden vs trump they will be warren vs pence i think biden will choose warren as his running mate choose wisely #election2020

hugely irresponsible of #bbcqt to tweet this clip without clarifying how he is factually wrong re the top 5% of earners an explainer on how tax thresholds work plus examples of impact at say gbp85k & gbp100k would contribute more to public service than shouty misinformed opinions

what we learned from the 2 town halls this week trump will lie about everything making it impossible for a fair debate and biden knows more about important topics than trump and is better at connecting with people debate moderators need to be prepared #debates2020

i think its a weak argument when sports analyst speak on the better team playing down to their opponent rather then giving credit when credit is due for maybe the lesser team playing good ball there are pros on both sides of the ball #nfl
it occurred to me that part of trumps interruption strategy was to take advantage of bidens stutter to make him look bad its a low blow and totally on-brand for trump #debates2020

couple of observations from todays #nfl action tom brady is not a great qb and the @dallascowboys are as usual not as good as expected by like every media outlet
can i just say shame on those officials gop media and supporters that made trumps actions acceptable over the last 5 years this administration is simply disgusting no leadership no class no decency no equality no humility no democracy #election2020
great match not quite as good as the one last month but still very good the cheap finish sucks but it does put heat on gunther and saves sheamus title win for an even bigger stage no complaints #smackdown

the #nfl who is supposed to be producing a product that fans want to watch are actively enforcing a rule that every fan hates and makes the game worse
#nfl the league should be held fully responsible for any attacks or harm that come to any police officers in this year following any dramatization of police brutality in any commercials played during the super bowl any network that shows that ad should be held responsible
ameobi again on his fucking heels loose ball and hes trotting fucking fight no desire to win and we end up defending the reason youre a nothing player is cos you coast talent isnt enough pisses me off #nffc

my prediction for tonights #debates2020 is two senile old white guys will each try to land the perfect meaningless sound bite zinger while the network treats the whole thing like a game show and not one person watching at home will change his or her mind

that can only be described as a proper thrashing for #nffc tonight lets hope thats the worst it gets this season things will turn around lots of new players for sure but with last seasons squad wed have probably been into double figure territory
#r4today so what do we know about the metropolitan police institutionally racist institutionally misogynistic institutionally corrupt oh lets have a another review
you throw it to the one receiver in the area surrounded by multiple defenders instead of towards the 3 or so receivers who give you a better chance off a tipped pass or something lol #nfl
just getting around to watching smackdown since it was pretty empted in my area due to football so far the highlight is bianca putting over liv in a loss liv looked like a million bucks when it was down to the two of them #smackdown
ravens clearly the best team in the #nfl beaten the 2 best defences got the mvp leader excellent run game very good defence and a possible hof kicker who is ice cold in the biggest moments if they get the 1 seed just put them in superbowl @ravens
im assuming that any #nfl fan saying its not the refs fault the cowboys lost will have that same energy for the remainder of the playoffs and not complain about the refs or focus on nfl officiating in any form but just break down what the teams qbs who lost did wrong
his plan to lean into herd immunity would accept 2m deaths as a bare minimum and possibly as high as 6m if it works at all it may not even create immunity in which would compound the travesty only if he changes his plan can he even claim to avoid 2m #debates2020
how many #dnd dms are okay starting their pcs at 3rd level if the adventure purports to start at 1st level in rime of the frostmaiden it is deadly at the beginning are you okay with starting them at 3rd lvl instead

fair play to @forza_garibaldi for asking the club the difficult questions though if they answer them remains to be seen lots of damage has already been done but @nffctrust nowhere to be seen meant to be the official voice but nothing but silence when clubs in free fall #nffc
i like what biden said you look down on people of faith because people think trump is supportive of christianity and other beliefs but its far from the truth he represents evil in christianity not what i believe in or support #debates2020
its looks like the bucs more or less made one major change qb in the off-season does it say more about jamies winston or tom brady that that the bucs went from 7-9 to the super bowl in one year #nfl
#debates2020 equity equality the constitution is what is it is about says @joebiden trump said there were very fine people on both sides trump came out of the bunker and used tear gas on peaceful protestors

ego and audacity of him to still refuse acceptance of the fact that a person has literally confessed her #mentalhealth struggles admitted on national television about being suicidal its sad to see a journalist with a strong platform stigmatize someones mental welfare
its no suprise that @realdonaldtrump is not accepting his defeate in the #election2020 he has never ever accepted any kind of a defeat not in the few republican primaries caususes that he lost not in the 2016 popular vote and not in his life befiore that either

i think it is really good that #r4today announces the same tory pr over and over again about levelling up but then never bothers to actually report that on the ground apart from a few potemkin projects that it is just smoke and mirrors

seems like one strategy for lack of better word by trump is to get joe to either commit to exact policies from bernie or if he doesnt then say he lost the left and try and divide us i voted for bernie in 2016 we arent going to let this strategy work #debates2020

i personally believe that each side should be forced to give half of their campaign funds to pay for judge judy to officiate the final debates admit it shes the only one who can do this america needs this #debates2020
this is so fucking disturbing americans are truly in a fight for their democracy this is the last exit before a long dangerous road into darkness #election2020
ah see that james cleverley is on #bbcqt and was just wondering how long it took well anyone really to chew him up and then spit him out as is what usually happens when he makes any tv appearance

#bbcqt i dont particularly like jeremy corbyn but compared to boris johnson hes fairly decent i really hope this audience are as harsh with bojo regarding his track record of lying cheating and misappropriation
so #nffc fans carvalho scores 2 against bradford and he should start every week it was only bradford doesnt matter you can only beat whats in front of you lolley has a stormer against blackburn u21 and hes still rubbish
bbc3 was a failure on terrestrial last time and will be again bear in mind that 65 percent of young people dont watch anything on a tv at all #r4today
everyone could benefit from therapy i do agree with this i also feel therapy & mental health needs to be normalised however people believe that they are the problem if everyone needs therapy the problem is systemic & societal yet we shame the individual #mentalhealth
i can see why @realdonaldtrump likes chris wallace and @foxnews so much both he and wallace are totally incompetent at their respective jobs #debates2020
its 3am i dont know if i can take biden mumbling or change direction in most of his sentences so far if hed call trump a clown more often it might be worth it its nice to see a political twitch stream at 120k viewers though #debates2020
are drinks spiked or are people putting doubles or trebles in them hypodermic syringes is scary for many reasons women shouldnt have to live like this #bbcqt
joe encouraging the people to vote and compelling people to do it the best way that makes them feel comfortable was the best part of this debate so far #debates2020
#bbcqt shes such a patronising person now shes talking to him like his a child and fiona bruce has fallen asleep while this turns into an american politics show rather than discussing whats going on in this country or even france
its tough living in a country that gets taken over by extremists who then force you to live under their ideology however obviously incompatible with the modern world hopefully its temporary #r4today
so i heard that opensea approached the #nfl about running a super bowl ad the league said no they cant use commercials that are slow to start lag like hell and advertise way out of date info
obama said were gonna be in a war -- trump yes he was telling you that because he felt north korea will continue building up nuclear capabilities you mr president has had them scale up their testing and arsenal so north korea got exactly what they wanted #debates2020
i know this match is going to end in a disqualification with naomi winning but not the title because she didnt pin or submit i know im going to be upset #smackdown

indeed apparently pointing out deliberate use of the word piccaninnies to describe black people is somehow not fair because he didnt do it all that much #bbcqt
seeing white people getting excited about trevor phillips using the black-on-black crime trope is vile people love to frame it this way yet never say what about white-on-white rape paedophiles murder etc why because white people would lose their shit if we said that #bbcqt
the truth from the audience ends @bbcquestiontime the truth if you watched youll know well done to the brave woman who spoke it & thank you so much it means more than you could possibly know #bbcqt
come onto the #nffc timeline for the 1st time today and it now seems that johnson is off to brentford cooper is about to walk karanka style and marinakis is back to being a wanker absolutely outstanding
anybody whos ever been on a debate team has to be sick watching how terrible this is debate is an art this is a kindergarten project not even hung up on the fridge #debates2020
so #dnd what happens if you throw a deck of many things at another person in a way that all the cards scatter what if someone catches a card mid fall how about deck of many things pick up shoot all the cards at target

trump is not campaigning for the presidency anymore hes campaigning for armed white supremacists to help him take over our democracy by intimidating voters and riot our only hope is to vote early and win by an unquestionable landslide #debates2020
biden winning isnt because of any blind faith in the dnc and whoever they pick hell i was mad bernie got screwed again but because of all of our collective disdain towards trump and his leadership #election2020
no one will discuss there mental health with anyone around them cause theres still a stigma of making you feel like theres something wrong with you or that your weak plus theres the embarrassment side of it if they cant keep your secrets to themselves #mentalhealth
rams won that trade in my opinion you can find great players in all rounds of the draft if you have a great scouting department so the first round picks dont mean much #nfl
if youd have offered a point off safety going into the world cup break at the start of the season id have bitten your hand off brilliantly important win today come on you shaggin redsss #nffc

that whole programme was very unpleasant from the smarmy questions to corbyn through the vicious attacks on swinson wot no lib dems in the audience at all to the soft soap wiff waff nonsense with johnson depressing #bbcqt
yeah this is pretty normal fucking losers maybe in a third world nation how the fuck is this the united states of america gun oil all freezer stocked ammo stay frosty patriots i go to work every day but will be ready for what comes calling of required #election2020
have some personal aim beyond the base setting of the campaign such as wanting to learn something new or find a certain item person gives them a natural character ark that both the player and dm can naturally see through #dnd
the oldest schism in the #dnd fanbase was in the late 70s early 80s and it was between the already grognard-y hardline wargamers and the new blood actors aka people who played the game theatrically cr didnt change how d&d is played it just de-nerded it 1 3
i fw the smackdown ending tbh edge rey mysterio and dominik attacked the bloodline and its kinda aggravating how roman keeps getting beat up in brawls against others babyface roman reigns would beat anyone in a brawl but he looked kinda weak in this brawl imo #smackdown
i have struggled so much with my #mentalhealth recently i was so petrified there was no way out for weeks i havent recognised myself then these last 2 days there have been little wins that i have taken & im taking baby steps & knowing who to reach out to

biden response to trumps claims what are you hiding focuses on trumps chinese bank account paying more taxes to china than us not releasing tax returns etc #debates2020

to sort of quote the bible here is my basic foundational assessment of next weeks #election2020 with my belief that the rust belt is likely determinative and now these three remain michigan wisconson and pennsylvania but the greatest of these is pennsyslvania
#election2020 think of how much larger the popular vote would be for biden if the extraordinary voter suppression tactics werent so effective the republicans suppressed about a million votes in florida alone
true but there is a reason fox puts #nfl on its air and the @themlbplayoffs on cable and not the other way around plus baseball featured a ny team largest market nfl was @broncos and @chiefs not exactly appointment tv
pence is showing he can be brutish just like the potus having gone over his time and lying with a straight face there is no evidence the biden ticket wants to raise taxes across the board they want to bring american jobs back #debates2020
sitting here asking my friends if theyre going to watch the #debates2020 like its the super bowl not because its important but because in these trying times we need something to laugh at
#bbcqt this quoting johnsons comments of the burkah out of context has to be called out there were 2 muslim women screaming about it yet had never even read the article which actually supported them but were only interested in the anti boris mobs divisive version of it
#nfl when registering for info on the game played in minich theres a spot for land usa is not one of the choices cant continue on without selecting a country so now what you dont want any americans to attend or what

so was ready to watch #bbcqt however my mum is watching a cooking show and deciding what she wants to cook today that made me smile and realised how much i missed these small little moments with my mum

hes literally giving orders to his racist followers from the presidential debate podium live on tv this is fucking insane what in the fuck is this country anymore #debates2020
with the exception of the nikki cross v lacey evans match and the lucha house party this #smackdown has been really solid highlight being that paul heyman video package
the last 2 & a half years have filled me with hatred probably not healthy but #mentalhealth took a back seat since the pandemic started anyways so who cares

heard a rumor that #dnd 5 5 might kill the short rest due to a new book editing most races to remove their short rest recharges while short rests were criminally underutilized in the community far too often i cant say that as a dm im a fan of this thread
all other #smackdown shortcomings aside the effort to plant the seed and subtly hint at a @realkillerkross debut makes it feel like it will be a big deal colour me excited
for any budding authors out there why dont you interview as many people as possible employed by #nffc staff & players from 1975 1993 and get as many brian clough stories as you can the more unheard of the better stick em in a book guaranteed best seller

still thinking about that one time joe biden put his finger in my face and tried to act like he knows a single fucking thing about being middle class or having to hold off on buying new tires #debates2020
not usually a fan of super edgy characters but damn this new #dnd character concept kinda fucks its very dark tho lmao i wanna play him so bad i might retire my current pc
i find some of the culture against short rests in #dnd fascinating some people really like not allowing them the times when those hours are super critical or risky isnt the norm so id be inclined just to let people have as many as they want
#bbcqt all the recent decisions regarding covid in the uk have been made by tories in isolation of the eu 15 billion has gone missing for a track and trace app the eu version cost 32 million i trust eu not tories

will the handwringing lead to an end to knife crime get brexit done one up to cummings get knife crime done up for everyone but is the big cum up to it #bbcqt
no point dominating the game and having all these chances supposedly if we cant even score and take advantage whats the point put ameobi and taylor on please #nffc

#r4today i wonder if @justinonweb mansplaining and sniping at @marthakearney is what is considered to be banter on @bbcr4today extremely irritating to hear and not for the first time
i think biden is actually angry about this good to see hes passionate about the nuclear family trump admits that his administration changed the policy and now states the forced orphans are in clean facilities and well taken care of bullshit #debates2020
more bizarro election thoughts democrats primary strategy do as little as possible and see if trump self-destructs republicans primary strategy stop voters from exercising their constitutional right to vote #election2020

it sounds like its not the 1st time bostnic has taken a cheap shot i hope @andydalton14 is fine and it wasnt as bad as it looked #nfl needs to look hard at this one
i get the impression that #dnd 5 5e could just replace the paladin class name for zealot leaving the rest as it is no need to be lawful good no need for deities as i was told theyre powered by larger than life commitment to something so in other words zealotry
johnson has long been advised by the wrong people bad comms no respect of time inability to listen to truth and sound advice voteleave admin will keep inflicting damage on people they do not care their arrogance is a constant factor not a variable one #r4today

another #nfl legend always loved how dan reeves served as a simultaneous player coach under tom landry was a different nfl back then many remember reeves as a coach but he was also a terrific rb for the cowboys for 7 years 2x super bowl champ 2x coty all-time great
so a couple of players decide to attack a heavily armored fighter and got beaten and caught by guards i love #dnd now to plan their execution if they dont figure out a better defense than i wanted a powerful thrall
fully expected watford to have more quality than us today but very disappointed that were getting knocked off the ball so easily samba sow would have been very useful to have in the side today #nffc
