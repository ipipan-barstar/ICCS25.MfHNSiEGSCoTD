i see it #browns you know he is trying to prove his worth for a new contract right now might have something to do with that we dont know whats going on so stop panicking
let me be clear even though he says its because he doesnt want to give the media the satisfaction of seeing him wearing a mask @realdonaldtrump refuses to wear a mask because he does not care if others die how juvenile and hateful he is #covid_19 november 3rd cant wait

my takeaway from this episode of #rhobh is that no one actually knows what gaslighting is and is erroneously using the term like how they did do with bullying

yes erika is intimidating only way to deal with her lot is look her in the eye and give it back erika is deflecting and has misplaced anger not cool @suttonbstracke is ur scapegoat sutton is not the problem #rhobh
latest #rhobh thoughts teddi and erika do the most in their confessionals kyle and dorit together arent as funny as they think they are mainly kims sisters fault garcelle putting kyle rinna and dorit in their place aaron is a control freak
primary debate format is god awful it should be a reality show instead with challenges etc but instead here we are listening to each candidate tell a story about some person they met or what car they rode in as a child #demdebate
i hope they mention this at the reunion as well as erikas aggressive reaction while garcelle was calm and just removed herself and son from such negativity #rhobh
is your candidate funded by big pharma big ag it big oil if so they are not your candidate they are already bought demand better demand democracy #demdebate
teddi is one of those people who likes to tell other people when she decides they r full of shit meanwhile she is the most full of shit in the room #rhobh

we live in a country that just threw down $1 5 trillion to minimize the economic impact of #covid_19 but had somehow only tested a few thousand people wont guarantee loa for those affected by the disease and has no clear plan to contain it either
hopefully the need to tackle the spread of #covid_19 and find vaccinations to reduce future outbreaks will promote the culture of cooperation in research and development in medicinal and health sectors countries need more integration not less of it

key point in this all has been how you can say you will get this and that and all you want when its a negotiation process he might as well told barnier he had to buy bj a ferrari mindless bs that everyone is seemingly ignoring #brexit
erika is one self absorbed woman as most of these housewives are but she is tv gold and i dont ever want her to be fired from rhobh sorry not sorry #rhobh

#bb22 davonne was one of the few big highlights this season i always loved her and while her gameplay hasnt been the best everything with her heart and personality and determination always made her awesome to watch her winning her first veto was the most happy i felt seeing
by rejecting the efta option we are now on a trajectory to being a passive rule taker and back on the ratchet which is neither desirable nor tolerable in respect of that #brexit as will be delivered does not meaningfully resolve our philosophical disagreement with brussels

for what its worth i thought firpo looked good today salah is obviously a very difficult player to be up against but he showed flashes of the good player he will be for us #lufc

re #covid_19 i know the intention at the state and federal levels seem to be lets take this 15 or 30 days at a time but i really believe life as we knew it wont be back for awhile 1 7
here come the lazy ted lasso comments when we were for the most part the superior team and just couldnt get a ball in the back of the net get fucked #lufc
i believe the #browns are 15-18 with baker mayfield at qb it sure beats the heck out of the 1-32-1 that preceded him but now is really the time for him to start feeling dangerous
did he tell them not to come here because he didnt like the city team or because he didnt like the qb who couldnt find him wide open last two ill give you and those are fair counters but the first one and the whole toxic diva shit you can miss me with #browns

genuinely appalled by news on #brexit the country which gave me my phd is committing political suicide thinking of my uk-based friends but also to ie be nl countries where people will suffer the effects of decisions they did not take these times are even harder for you all
the real unsung heroes of the #covid_19 war in india are the small medium large scale business men who without caring about their pockets still ensured continuity towards salaries
modern definition of inflation rising prices for goods and services old definition artificial increase in the money supply within an economy the definition was changed because the original one casts blame at the fed and the government which is true #btc

were all wondering why we arent getting the easy passes you see on other teams great stuff from @danorlovsky7 again explaining why on some baker not getting to open receivers and not trusting what hes seeing new scheme and he needs to trust it and get the ball out #browns
question for all of you watching many nfl games long crossing routes are a staple of great passing teams often how the best receivers get their most yards screwing up zone defense i dont recall one mid-deep crossing route did you i refuse to rewatch the game #browns

i enjoyed bielsa at leeds as much as anyone but these tributes and moaning about his sacking when 2 pts off relegation are getting proper cringey and embarrassing now i was brought up to think #lufc were a big club and not one person could be bigger so start acting like it
#covid_19 @ndtv @timesnow @aajtak can we not utilize these labours willing to go back into essential services those who are willing this will atleast give them some self earning sources and will stay where they are and not travel to different states

#gh why does sonny seem to have a more natural fatherly relationship with dante and kristina than josslyn and michael well josslyn isnt even his kid technically but its interesting how non-judgmental the former two are compared to the latter two
tonight i watched the #demdebate and real housewives of new jersey one show had name calling and yelling it was great reality television the other was the real housewives of new jersey
if this goes ahead are there going to be arrangements for every game to be televised football without fans isnt football @efl @premierleague #covid_19
seriously anyone else literally quietly smirking knowing these people like deadwood truly believe all will be well at port even after the patron saint of #brexit gove admitted next few weeks as traffic hits usual levels disruption is unavoidable
i think we have all started to fall back in like again with this dam game these shenanigans are what we love big alliances being in shambles finally now if they can just get tyler out this week whew #bb22
baker mayfield plays well for a stretch of games lets see him do it for a full season baker mayfield has one bad game the browns need to move on baker is terrible these baker haters demand consistency on a level they cant reach #browns
he should go somewhere else hes drained #gh & his thousand one redemption stories are never going to work & no matter how many times hes shoved down peoples throats hes not going to be liked
marcelo keeps picking casilla marcelo keeps picking bamford this starts with bielsa which other manager in championship allows them to play after shit performances week after week #lufc
when asked for to comment former #brexit secretary david davis believed it would all be fine as the u k held all the cards he went on to say there was no way the german car industry would allow such a thing to happen as it would hurt them more
the #browns seemed desperate from the get-go on offense as though stefanski was spooked by the blowout in the first game vs the ratbirds he forgot what got them to the point of playing in a big game
nospoilers this story is so predictable nina will believe nelle is her daughter then the twist will be that frank stole the necklace from willow again this is just my theory during #gh 57th anniversary week we get flashbacks & stories about newbies
i still cant believe the browns have amari cooper and david bell these two have to be the most slept on duo this off-season two extremely elite route runners with huge play making ability deshaun is about to have a field day #browns david njoku is about to have a year too
embarrassing stuff from ayling here the lack of trust to let klich manage the situation is pathetic just run into your own players against some of the best in the world dickheads #lufc
ok listen i think erika knows where the bodies are buried on each of these women and thats why shes gotten them on board with all of this rinna kyle and dorit imo garcelle crystal kathy and sutton legit know nothing and are being loyal #rhobh
#browns this loss is 95% on keven stefanski horrible game by him and his staff put fing points on board and stop with the dumb ass 4th down crap when youre trying to finish team off something other than draw play would be great what a waste
the third and final day of #browns qb deshaun watsons disciplinary hearing has wrapped up discipline officer sue l robinson has requested post-trial briefs from both sides and those are to be submitted by july 11 per @dangrazianoespn
breaking news trump never had #covid_19 trump and his staff falsified every aspect of his covid scam the purpose of the scam was to use himself as an example of how weak the virus is and that there are effective medications that supposedly he was given
can someone make a compilation of all the shit in crypto either youtubers freaking out or shib or something and then cut to @breedlove22 spitting the deepest shit youve ever conceived or @johnkvallis enlightening your entire existence to show the difference of #btc and crypto
#browns get back to running up the middle a and then the dump off to te on defense gotta keep getting pressure or we are screwed with all the injuries we have
#btc $btc hit 46800 from where we said morning but 43800 came with manipulations if it closes below 43000 the trend could return new major weekly support 43000 if the 43000 stays solid a big move will emerge
itll be interesting to see who plays where on saturday brighton have settled on 3-4-1-2 so youd imagine well line up 3-1-4-2 to counter the fact bamford struggles against a back 3 could very well see koch replace costa who picked up a back injury #lufc
the only positive for bay and day both being on the block is actually seeing two people game and negotiate with the house able to go either way imagine if we could have players playing all season sigh #bb22
if youre buying a car and suddenly agree to give up on having back seats the price will go down that doesnt make you a tactical mastermind it just means you gave up on something you previously insisted was vital #brexit
does nicole even care about winning again or believe theres any possibility she can because it sure seems like shes openly playing for cody to win #bb22
the only thing that could have made things better for leeds united tonight would have been if wed gotten the satisfaction of relegating a neil warnock managed club #lufc
#bb22 bayleigh kaysar and janelle in the key room bayleigh tells them that on her season none of this mingling would be happening we have nica tyler cody davonne keesha and david at the kitchen table playing board games
wow #lufc few fans saw that coming but that was some performance meslier superb and tyler adams outstanding mom journey home much happier we thoroughly deserved it too fair fucks to all involved
so todays #brexit reality is the reality that contrary to remoaners claims you dont need to be in the eu for supply lines to operate jit manufacturers use china not in eu because it suits them & being in the eu isnt a prerequisite or necessity for jit supply chains
well whats done is done on their heads be it just remember these people making decisions were not born a leeds fan theyre in it to make money theres a difference i thank marcelo & his staff for an amazing journey they truly got us in a way no other has in my lifetime #lufc

bought my first very very small piece of a #btc overnight with a couple limit buys at $38 2k and $39k only a couple hundred quid so nothing to write home about but lets see how often this gets topped up with no minimum value and microscopic fees
it must certainly mean that in fact why dont we measure the governments response to #covid_19 through approval ratings rather than the number of dead and infected people as if things werent bad enough
love bamford but he has to learn the art of a one touch finish theres nothing to think about 6 yards out he just over thinks at times he likes to learn so hopefully the coaching staff will help him #lufc

#browns have a great drive here running the ball well thus far good to see njoku get a touchdown from bake browns need a new kicker though i have next to zero confidence in austin
#browns fans if the chiefs beat the raiders we beat the eagles and the titans beat the ravens today the browns will be back in the top 7 in the afc and hold 2nd place in the afc north wouldnt that be great
#demdebate is a rumble no one is holding back is that good will this really help to cull the field and unite the party perhaps good to see they can all be snarky and in your face -- whoever is the nominee needs that quality in spades against trump

so what exactly is the difference between labour party and tory party on #brexit pro remain tories at least had the courage of their convictions and left when it was obvious that their leadership had been subverted not seeing many labour remainers doing the honourable thing
#browns need to let joe woods go unorganized vanilla defense yet loaded with talent was a defensive back but has the weakest secondary has had multiple years to put it together too and were nowhere advanced or progressed in any way ray horton was better
there are 2 views of the #covid_19 virus 1 this is a very dangerous virus and should be taken seriously 2 the media is encouraging fear and making this situation worse both of these statements can be true at the same time dont spread fear but dont take this lightly either
how many more black swan events do bears need to see 14k #btc or less so far weve had luna ust collapse celsius ftx alameda rumours of blockfi filing for bankruptcy and now were seeing potential talks of ww3

no mention of transnational drug cartel and role of sanctuary cities in protecting it spike in overdose drugs is from illicit drugs not prescriptions #demdebate
answer to the question that might have arisen when viewing the previous tweet why do not short #btc 1 in a low-liquidity market a short squeeze is not uncommon which increases the risk of this operation 2 such a position will require ongoing support to pay commissions
first the floor lowered the volume on this #demdebate and now the tv has been completely shut off like i said earlier you dont need to convince people to not vote for trump but that doesnt mean people are going to show up at the polls and vote for democrats either
reading twitter after the #demdebate proves one thing and one thing only every liberal in this country is a goddamn drama-sucking idiot are we so concerned with petty feuds between our potential presidential candidates that well snipe and sneer like this were doomed
if yall #browns fans keep talking that weird shit about moving on from baker instead of bolstering d and adding speed across the board on both sides of the ball i may have to stay off twitter until kickoff for the 2021 season
6 has not been great but this offense as a whole has been out of sync something is just not clicking baker stefanski offensive line receivers not getting open and separation penalties in the end it will always fall on the qb play and he just hasnt had any magic #browns
does anyone think that the #browns would throw a wrench in the works and try to do some deal with baker and obj for deandre watson especially since they are considering future baker options
im a fan of france but the abiding rancour against their ww2 allies in articles like this and in the comments is notable it may be a minority view but the bitterness & inability to forgive the uk for not being defeated and for our role in the liberation is clear #brexit
absolute disaster so far passes astray all over the field and no real attacking threat other than that bamford chance right at the start we really need to get going or we will be absolutely embarrassed tonight #lufc
#rhobh i wish rinna would not get renewed so bad what storyline has she ever had all she does is just talk shit about other people and stir the pot let her go bravo
i dont need to watch these debates there is a criminal in the white house that due to his direct sphere of influence nearly had an ambassador of the us assassinated give me a name that isnt djt and i am voting for it #demdebate

#browns should simply hire a general great leader who is detail oriented a guy who commands attention a tough sob harbaugh tomlin delegate they create culture and just lead they hand xs and os to excellent ocs dcs i dont think mcdaniels is that guy @hammernation19
the penny is finally dropping i love this lady hats off & respects for not only realising that she was manipulated but also taking responsibility for her actions #brexit
my question for tuesdays #demdebate if you were president what would you do to address the rampant corruption not only in the government but also within the democratic establishment will you be one of them or will you take a stand for the people you represent
#brexit why did he negotiate it then why did he get a peerage for negotiating it why did you support curtailing debate on it in parliament why was it the centrepiece of your election manifesto why did you campaign on that manifesto why did you vote for it hmm
#browns kevin stefanski play calling in the second half was absolutely awful and he botched that last drive not to mention our atrocious defense and leave the punter in la
improvement today looked more organised and had chances 19 in total next two games are massive we need to get behind the team next week which if you didnt realise includes the manager alaw remember #lufc

so after the @bbcnews put out a nationwide search for those having problems with #brexit it came back with some shellfish farmers restaurants are closed and some people moaning about buying a coat or gift online in the eu who does that and getting extra charges chaos
the fact that on that walk with crystal erika dismissed cussing jax out because she thought he was 16 doesnt sit right with me would erika cuss out 22 year old amelia or 32 year old farrah lets be honest race had a lot to do with her dismissing it easily #rhobh @garcelleb

it is a sad feeling being totally disenfranchised in the country where you are resident today is the german federal elections as eu members brits would not have had a vote in this but we would have been able to vote in local elections now we dont even have that #brexit
almost reassuring to see that #brexit is fulfilling its promise of letting britain reduce standards not having to follow those the eu puts in place to protect citizens whoevers the tory pm the uk is now run by the erg and were all poorer and less safe
lets face it if cnn really cared about the u s and its citizens why did they give billions of free coverage to trump in 2016 this lets come together part of the debate is pure theatre #demdebate

#demdebate why do these moderators let them go on and on when they are saying nothing why are they even talking about healthcare do we not know their positions
what is crystal clear from johnsons language is that he has zero intent to unite the country only divide it further to appeal to his base to get elected if anyone thinks that tactic will mean the end of #brexit then youre going to be in for a surprise

fascinating interview with paraag marathe of the san francisco 49ers and their involvement in #lufc but one thing i dont understand is what on earth is an american who specialises in nfl doing waving a cricket ball around in his left hand
jimmy g has thrown 2 tds and 5 interceptions in the playoffs and averages 120 yards per game and #browns fans want him over baker but he wins yea in spite of him sheesh
1st half comfortable lots of good things 2nd half a bit disjointed & rusty cos of substitutions and finished with what was essentially the u23s but friendlies are like that work in progress but plenty of positives just need to see improvement in every game #lufc

chance bamford goes through onto a pass from adams but stabs at it early and guaita gets down to parry it would need to see a replay to know if bamford was onside but in real time a great chance 0-1 on 22 mins #lufc
dont get it confused baker mayfield still sucks my gawd this is all on the #browns they control this game it was no reason that this game should come down to this a pathetic lost
i would distinguish between #brexit and the tory version of unplanned chaotic unicorn brexit brexit should have been properly debated planned it takes years and then implemented this shit show is just power grab and make some bucks while you are at it
#btc is used in togo to fight monetary colonialism afghanistan to protect gender rights lebanon to guard against hyperinflation nigeria to propel social movements for speculation purposes is a privilege many cant afford
great battle in the first half and #lufc 23s lead thanks to greenwoods penalty hopefully ayling and bamford have come through ok and leeds can keep taking the game to the citizens in the second 45
im not a huge @joebiden for president fan but i did kinda like this answer i just dont know how democrats can work with the current group of republicans they cant even agree on proven facts #demdebate

the #browns should draft a qb next year such as corral willis or pickett in rd 1 2 let baker play the 5th year option out if he lights it up responds to the adversity = awesome if it doesnt work you have a guy ready to go with a year of learning under his belt

they constantly talk over sutton and barely let her get a word out or explain her position then try to act like shes being manipulative or fake its so annoying #rhobh
were numb to how ridiculous 1-31 is in the nfl and were actually retaining hiring guys back that were in high level positions during that might as well bring hue back #browns
#rhobh its totally embarrassing watching the reunion & seeing the tears appearing in garcelles eyes shame on the cast andy & the producers the obvious disrespect thats displayed on this show & southern charm towards the only afro american female cast members is ridiculous

#brexit before labour can even start to be a credible opposition they need a centre ground leader and a complete clear out of the current front bench as long as abbot sits there the party will be judged accordingly momentum must be stripped of their influence

i wonder how the cast of #bb22 is going to react when they leave the house knowing the fans think this is the worst season ever game wise @cbsbigbrother
very true also we should be concerned about our international students who might be dealing with losses in their family due to this virus may you all have the strength in these difficult times sending virtual hugs to all we are in this together #covid_19
general hospital is about to come on but i am not in the mood to watch it today i am still mad that #gh had killed off holly & if i see peter on my screen i will throw a heavy object at it
kathy hilton ate this season has been annoying at times but its also be packed with drama and seeing girls like garcelle sutton and crystal shine has been amazing this reunion is going to be 1 for the books #rhobh
ok but i was expecting memphis to say something way worse to david when nominating him for have not based off of twitter and the reaction in the house #bb22
#gh omg they really do read our tweets did carly just ask ava why she was friends with nina after forcing ava into labor & stealing her baby hilarious ava gave a pretty good response people change although she could have said any enemy of yours is a friend of mine
browns offense looks way better when you dont have a qb missing wide open receivers the bengals defense have to respect the air attack which is helping our rushing attack it feels good to watch competent qb play which is all we needed to be relevant baker is trash #browns
my mom is even getting fed up with gh shes been watching this show for 41yrs strong to here her say she cant stand the peter sl makes me feel better we dont agree a lot when it comes to gh but we do agree this soap doesnt feel like #gh
kyle has to make others her storyline in order to remain relevant at the end of the day what does she truly bring to this show other than using her sisters as her storyline #rhobh
prior to week 15 #browns brass planned to stand with head coach freddie kitchens barring a disaster ending cleveland has since lost 3 in a row including today to the nfls worst team the haslams have a hard decision to make
honestly the most urgent thing is not to find someone to blame but ask government and people to work together to slow down and stop the transmission of #covid_19 if everyone is acting like those folks in bondi beach sydney yesterday then we are all fucked
i mean shes is the prettiest bh housewife tho so rt @real_housewives teddi is boring she thinks her place is cemented by being kyles footstool on #rhobh

#demdebate thank you 4 showing america who you are none of you have a chance against president trump he going to win in a electoral landslide because youre against the electoral college the supreme court & the constitution especially the 2nd u hypocrites
what a tragedy i could say we told you so but like most of my colleagues whove taken part in the brexit debates over the past 3 years i only feel despair at whats happening as full extent of #brexit reality has kicked in now waiting for the court cases to get going
none of us really thought that janelle and kaysar had anywhere near close to 10% win equity combined for #bb22 but its still a shame the season will take a nosedive in terms of entertainment if either or both are prejurors
wow it was certainly jarring to go from talking decriminalization of opioids and legalization of marijuana to true blue prosecutor kamala harris demonizing dope dealers yes i know she was talking about pharmacy execs doesnt change the context of that metaphor #demdebate
did biden just accidentally call bernie the president this is the second time hes made this mistake during a debate last time with another candidate #demdebate
if i was kevin davonne bay david or ian id like to think id see the writing on the wall knowing there have been hinky votes the last 2 weeks and that the house is pretty split anyway id take a risk and quietly flip the vote id rather do something than nothing #bb22
erika is far too arrogant for me sutton played it cool cause she definitely couldve went there its impossible to feel sorry for her at this point #rhobh
always wonder why we dont get more allstar seasons and then i remember that the ogs and experienced players have zero respect for production maybe thats why #bb22
how is a group of all stars going to see what happened to the jackasses last season and still act discriminatory towards the poc in the house and the guy with autism do yall just not give a single fuck about your reputation its very telling #bb22
oh #brexit what a wonderful thing you are i just sent my sister a birthday present specially as a gift from sweden to the uk it was tracked with a value of 1000 sek circa gbp85 she had to pay gbp25 in handling and customs fees what an absolute fucking shit show
just in case we were in any kind of doubt that boris #brexit deal is total bullshit it makes reference to netscape communicator as being cutting edge internet technology good grief
i want to be empathetic to those feeling weight from decisions made by the @browns organization for those jumping ship to other teams best of luck there are plenty of guys on this roster that do well by our communities and our kids i will continue to support them #browns
#rhobh maybe you should just stay home it isnt up to sutton to worry about cameras upsetting you she wants publicity for her store you should have expected it you didnt have a problem with it at kyles store party
this clip made me mad all over again bc if i was kemi i would have acted an ass #bb22 like i would never be invited back to a damn thing on viacom thats how bad i would have acted
nicole f crying because she says janelle scares the shit out of her 3 seasons now of her constant whining please someone nom and vote her out asap #bb22
heres why i dont listen to the snap judgement #browns weekend qb analysts the younger generation only knows winning from baker so they have nothing to compare the older generation compares him to bernie who finished his browns career only 2 games over 500
bayleigh- you are right going home is so much better than sitting in jury for seven weeks it literally has to be all or nothing janelle- i am not sitting for seven weeks to vote someone a winner unless its you jury is too long #bb22
i get the argument if rudolph said something to escalate it that would not be a reason to hit him but there is no precedent for an indefinite suspension nfl makes you their own rules i guess and myles gets to be the example #browns

only the #browns can come off a bye week and have more injuries covid situations than prior to the bye week being a fan of this organization is the most taxing demoralizing mentally draining process players dont understand what fans have dealt with over the last 20 years
the amount of clubs going into administration and getting run into the ground is crazy and yet fans are calling for radz head cause hes not backed mb by throwing gbp300m into transfers #lufc twitter is fucking depressing and full of moaners and fucking idiots

so odell beckham jr has an arrest warrant for touching a police officers ass in a victory celebration just saying it was like an atta boy slap the money issue was stupid but celebrating a win and this is the result minor battery this is what weve become as a country #browns

turns out that the crap selfie i had to take to apply for an eu immigration status for #brexit is now shown to employers who want to check on my right to work how would that go down with bias and diversity in the hiring process not even speaking about data privacy here
whatever else in this sorry mess of #brexit our politicians @simoncoveney @hmcentee @leovaradkar delivered with eu solidarity the best possible outcome for nirl
its more risky to invest in the s&p 500 or legacy system than investing in in #btc why because crypto is going to have a $200 trillion market cap its current at $2 7 trillion missing those gains is risky
this could backfire on bayday though since they are popular on sm who will you blame then think before you act although it seems impossible to give advice to people who act like children who didnt get their way #bb22
its a cruel world when you mix people underestimating the proportions of a disease like #covid_19 and antivaxers most probably its not them both that die at the end but some collaterals
tyler is a crybaby privileged twerp & only enjoys his time in the house when hes in control that being said he tried to pull of a blindside to get nicole out and his hohs have eliminated two of the best bb players of all time i guess hes the only one left to root for #bb22

the video has info on how to trade #btc intraday or swing trade during this extended correction some of you may benefit from that edutainment info youtube is still processing the video you may want to give it some time
enzo while keeping a bigger target than yourself tyler around makes sense you never applied that rule with janelle or kaysar and keeping tyler around too long just gives him the chance of making it to the end and winning #bb22
i can there are a lot of people out there that think its funny to be selfish and cruel like erika and rinna hence the term mean girls its really sad because its usually hurt insecure people #rhobh

#browns have 5 games remaining if they lose 2 of those 5 they wont make the playoffs a very small chance they can only afford to lose 1 more game this year and that wont 100% guarantee a playoff spot but there will be a good chance 5-0 obviously gets them into the dance

the goal is to win the season and if the jury voted for you then you earned that win you did something better from your opponent throughout the season #bb22 some things that many bb fans dont respect or understand
i remember buying a decent size of #btc at the $6k range only to watch it dump to $3k and asking myself how do i lose 50% at these levels how does crypto recover from this only for it to 20x from there when you survive that you become optimistic of the present opportunities
we dominated that last 20 mins but even half overall 1-1 would be a fairer reflection of the game villa limited to long shots other than the goal so leeds just need to be a bit better in front of goal could end 3-1 or 0-3 #lufc

bottom line baker was clearly trending up and putting it all together 2020 and beginning of 2021 most qbs take time to get there he had 4 different coaches in the process he gets injured and he regresses what is so difficult for people to understand #browns
if i was married to a man that was a fraud and stole money from victims that suffered from massive tragedy i think i would be a bit more silent even if you arent fully involved your actions say a lot welcome to the ej show and self victim she is disgusting #rhobh

hey @daltonross so you released a statement earlier today saying that memphis didnt say the n word & that any houseguest that says a derogatory term slur would be removed david just confirmed he was called one investigate this immediately or your statement means nothing #bb22

#bb22 janelle tells nica there are several people that want her to stay nica tells her that its up to the house as to who goes home she says that if noms stay the same im gone jan says that memphis is just too scared to do anything
the reason so many people are struggling is because there is no unity this is what #brexit highlighted and how we have to move forward anger abounds isolation confounds and everyone is fucked off channel all the inner-resolve you have and stand
theres nothing like #browns fans overhyping our free agent signings its both charming and tragic theyre nice free agent signings but not earth-shattering
sonny sends his body guard to go what carly is doing carly tells jax she cant habdle anymore and she hasnt gotten much sleep jax tells her everything will be fine then they hug he tells her hes always there for her the body guard sees #gh

if you lost sleep for 1h every night over brexit you have lost 1225 hours of sleep on oct 31 according to a study from 2016 it takes four days to recover from one hour of lost sleep so you will need 4900 nights to catch up which is more than 13 years sleep well #brexit

johnsons government need to take a humility pill and admit that #brexit is a major fup was always going to be a major fup and will continue to be a major fup until it is reversed its time to humbly swallow their tory pride and return to the european union family

#demdebate moderators please end the practice of raising hands and interruptions by requiring each candidate to wait until a question is directed to them the resulting chaos is too painful to watch
arent social media radio and tv so much nicer and far less irritating now #brexit has been finalised because of the general election the country is quietly healing and coming back together it seems the main people now prolonging division are the labour leadership candidates
ill say it again if bloomberg wanted to do what hes doing and hold these positions he should have run as a republican and primaried trump fuck him #demdebate
everyone in the fanbase can feel this team is coming alive except the media lets support our #browns and ignore their trash tabloid garbage ive never been more excited as a browns fan and our own media wants to hamper it
and heres the honest truth- i dont see the browns holding the titans to less than 30 they are simply too good and too smart of a team so the offense needs to keep the pedal down #browns
shame about the result but absolutely sublime football from #lufc once again while the rest of us labour away in 2021 it feels like bielsa has his lads playing in 3021 incredible stuff
this man is the epitome of superfan attitude dont get me wrong i like some of his content the videos and i dont disagree with season ticket holders getting some benefits and look hes like 19 20 years old like all the other superfans #lufc

i see #brexit is slowly making a comeback im sick of it already in hindsight @david_cameron should have resigned before he ever got to call a referendum he should have got those reforms the country wanted what a total loser he is the absolute mess he allowed

and yet hes quite factual in his statement remember when over 600 elderly people died because there was no effective #covid_19 protocol in their aged care facilities
all nice possession creating great chances to score but the lack of top-quality to finish combined with amateurish defending makes for games like these difficult to watch west ham are well organised with confidence hard to beat #lufc
so #btc has formed a ll and $eth still hasnt by the looks of it $eth should follow $btc i am about to fly out in minutes so hopefully by the time i land some nice trading setups are ready if you are trading enjoy trading and be safe if you are on sidelines like me
as a member sometimes wonder the issue isnt so much the clear idea about #brexit policy that i can live with it seems to me it is the arrogant attitude in presentation that needs a tweak 17 4 m votes short or 52% less votes you will lose they must not allow corbyn in agreed
tbh i feel less safe wearing a damn mask because i keep having to touch my face to take it off & put it on again people are gonna infect themselves wearing dirty ass masks #covid_19
lets not sugar coat it defending these last 2 games has been awful get phillips and rodrigo back and get raphinha in that first xi and yes i am triggered #lufc
bielsa has worked a miracle at #lufc but this does not make him infallible there are times it appears he is up his own ass & believes he is a genius believing that he can transform a cb into a epl quality cm & a winger in to a cf bielsas ineptitude cost us an easy win today

i have to say this is slightly mad- it is not clear what the sense of this is and if eu nationals here get a quid pro quo does this mean their own savings bank accounts could be closed at home-in days of yore travellers kept gold sovereigns in their socks #brexit
cooper starts debate by asking each candidate about impeachment warren sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics sanders i look forward to a speedy impeachment process biden this is the most corrupt president in all of our history #demdebate

perfect solution to the #brexit heckler in parliament square who likes to ruin media broadcasters hire a helicopter to drown out bellowing from his megaphone

what a surprise jed wallace who previously converted five penalties out of five for millwall just happens to miss a penalty against fulham which would have made the score 2-1 to millwall wow #lufc
serious post anyone else concerned for their mental health because of how much they refresh twitter watch feeds or care about the outcome of this game it pretty much rules my life right now and the events of this week have very much affected my general mood #bb22
wonder how bad the officials are gonna screw the browns tonight to make sure ben dont lose his final home game cause i already know its gonna happen i hope cleveland sends that sob limping out of the stadium into retirement fuck pittsburgh go browns #browns
i just dont get it #gh was about to be cancelled 10 years ago cancelled that alone should have humbled everyone be grateful you still have a job and all that stupid petty kiss the ring king of the hill crap should have ceased
does deshaun play defense that defense is trash and gives up big play after big play the #browns could score 30 points with deshaun but can also give up 30 points on defense

#rhobh pity party time for the fake housewives erika the liar kyle the narcissist rinna the anorexic crystal the mean girl idiot and the worst actor ever kathy hilton end this show now
my last rt with #demdebate speaking times is why its hard to sit through nearly 180 mins of tv seven of the candidates spoke for under 13 mins why is anyone ok with 12 candidates on stage at any place other than a state fair
might only be a picture but this sums up sam greenwood at #lufc hes a grafter signed from arsenal with a good goals record as a centre-forward who occasionally played out wide hes slotted in at no 8 with no complaints and still managed to hit seven goals top work ethic

the nikolas alexis relationship is really underplayed imo for a lot of years nikolas only had stefan & alexis to count on other than helena #gh thats probably why i love fanfic that has nikolas & alexis bonded more like she raised him rather than a distant relative

im so sick of seeing kristina for 2 minutes or 2 episodes and then nothing for months why is there more story for willow and sasha than a legacy character their age i get shes not contract but neither is valentin and hes everywhere #gh @generalhospital @valentinifrank

so baker makes a bad throw and because he makes a bad throw that gets picked obj ends up getting hurt trying to make a tackle this is #browns meets 2020
the sad thing with #brexit is that everything is now framed as a confrontation competition eu screwed up uk did better or vice versa this is bound to lead to resentment and divisions for example with vaccines if uk had stayed in eu 1 2

bayday and ian stans really are braver than the us marines the struggle we go through watching our faves gameplay decisions is incomparable to anything else #bb22
sutton 1000% was correct in saying the group is scared of erika and are using her to get their questions answered they need to nut tf up and hold they girl accountable instead of letting sutton and garcelle do it then chastising them afterwards #rhobh
of course when the final piece of #brexit shite has splattered through the weary fan the architects and mouthpieces for it will simply walk away from the shambles we are left with gleefully clutching onto their overseas tax dodging investment accounts and bulging pensions
3 big games now to prove this team has an inch of fight in them have to pray that those just below us dont pick up any points and to those who have said the whole season that well be fine how are you feeling now #lufc
i hope janelle and kaysar dont push too much for nicole a to stay cause she is actually against them and if they evict her david can join bay and day and make a 5 people alliance #bb22

so some people who supported #brexit acquired some contracts and their opponents too does that make brexit invalid a push by a bunch of crooks the remainer lobby will stop at nothing to paint brexiteers as corrupt cheats crooks even just by innuendo

when you elect a prime minister and a govt purely because of their policy on one single issue #brexit you cannot then complain when their incompetence in every other area is exposed but when their incompetence and dishonesty on that single issue is exposed as well

omg is no one allowed to despise sonny anymore on #gh you have taggert shaking his hand and monica allowing him in her home its disappointing & maddening
the galling thing is yes there were true believers of #brexit but the ones like michael gove and boris johnson who jumped on the bandwagon for political promotion should be ashamed of themselves and never forgiven for hobbling the uk economy

bricking it here but they have also played 2 attacking midfielders like us but you can do when you have vvd there will be goals in this i just hope we score some of them #lufc

it didnt work an opi was called we needed 2 yards down by 3 with plenty of time on the clock run the ball pick up the first or dont pickup the first and at least give the team a shot at 3 points to tie #browns
oh & for the record you had to love archuletta & dedes constantly talking about how short handed jacksoville was like the #browns had the use of their entire team roster theyre 2 of the worst commentators out there
right that is me on twitter done for anything #lufc related until the end of the season i hope we are still in the pl but its looking increasingly unlikely given the way we are performing under jesse marsch i wont forgive the board for their poor investment on off the pitch

uk senior minister michael gove we want the best possible trading relationship with the eu but in pursuit of a deal we will not trade away our sovereignty #brexit
ill wait till next week to see the full scene but i think kyle would call out anyone for allegedly not paying i dont think race played a factor #rhobh
anyone thinking #brexit is the only issue in the election should consider visiting a school affected by austerity there youll find departments with not enough money in their budget to buy a single set of textbooks for any class
oom zweli winter is upon us and with the blossoming of trees in spring comes hay fever people will be suspected of being #covid_19 carriers we are far from being out of the woods this is a delayed exponential curve

so @annemariemorris my tory epsilon mp at what point will you admit your failings lies distortions conceit and complete failure to represent to your constituents the truth that you were aware of of #brexit
then why you didnt put her up on week 4 when you was hoh enzo kaysar was not coming after you or wasnt doing anything shady kaysar was probably gonna put cody on the block if he won hoh #bb22

#btc price analysis bitcoins going parabolic since halving but now facing the real resistance area the recent surge from $8k was parabolic and had only minor corrections a healthy rise is not parabolic
to buy btc you need people that want to sell it to you but no everyones to sell so you come to the influencers and them says to the holders to sell his btc and then the insitutions and the same influencers buy this btc its another cryptobusiness #btc

now that $luna is within 4-5% of the 618 fib level and futures are looking okay i would expect for shorts to start covering some down in here ive actually started to scale in a bit here however if #btc would randomly dump hard this thing could be at $30 before you know it

i liked dani on s13 until she targeted rachel i like her right now but if she aligns with ratcole and targets janelle and keesha then shes officially canceled #bb22

the fact that kaysar and janelle had 0 chance coming into this house makes this season forever frustrating because no matter how much sense either of them spoke nothing was going to change their position in the game because this cast is dogshit #bb22
the negotiations were a dismal failure possibility now of hard and mutually destructive #brexit yeah great job would love to know what youd see as a terrible job
except for deporting dangerous criminal elements from the unending floods of middle eastern cultural enrichment #brexit means no human shall be illegal in britain

absolutely bxp vote is a wasted one and ironically lead to no #brexit with corbyn destroying the country farage should stand down majority of his candidates for sake of country
the only way i see day escaping this situation is if she presents the info as if david is a liar that may save her game with tyler but i guess well see how the talk goes later #bb22
cant handle dorit talking about the supposed break in she said i saw a big person not a lil person wait was that a jab at her husband puke he has gained weight but not that much #rhobh
day asked tyler if he was using the black live matters movement as a strategy thats thinking ver low and disgusting about someone i really hope she starts believing him shes in jury bc she didnt #bb22
never forget as we career towards a no deal #brexit that the majority of people in this country now do not want brexit at all if johnson fails to get a deal his political career is finished as indeed is the tory party small consolation but consolation nonetheless
doesnt matter who the manager is btw they still have that travesty of a defence to use where we still use league 1 liam even last week he couldve cost us 3 goals but meslier bailed him out #lufc
still waiting for a #brexit voter or instigator to provide me with a tangible gain one that makes all these losses worth while come on guys is it too much to ask

we can talk on the phone every day but its not the same as sharing in each others lives no lies told there things happen lives change in small and big ways now that youre back in the same house time to figure out how things have changed and adjust #gh
our fan base is so terrible some player will some wont be good enough but to be at them everyday is beyond a joke tr is our player like it or not stop the bullshit and back the team must be 4 -5 players in his boat but he gets it everyday sad delete block what ever #lufc

free #covid_19 tests must be not only for americans but for illegals too @realdonaldtrump because if someone has it and cant afford a test they will infect others
problem is the entire browns media loves stefanski so no one will acknowledge or question how badly he screwed up this game he doesnt know how to coach with the lead versus good teams #browns

#browns greedy williams said it felt great to get in pads and into team drills said theyre working on getting his shoulder to 100% said theres no restrictions and believes he did good work in the offseason to get back on the field
after that game i can see why #lufc fans beat the drum for phillips and if dunky was playing today and put in a masterclass im sure people would understand us too
i want bayday to just drag them all this playing nice shit isnt going to cut it anymore for once they need to be held accountable while still in the house #bb22

i wonder how many eu migrants @davidlammy knows personally post #brexit eu nationals and migrant workers will still be able to register to study and or work in britain this is something that @borisjohnson and the government have always maintained
any #brexit was bad but its never been about the economy the not so hidden agenda has always been about self interest making money for the few whilst stripping the many of their rights & protections that get in the way of that whilst imposing of a narrow rightwing agenda
kevin kaysar has credibility he knows whats been going on in the house since night one your just now waking up and kaysar doesnt need to spill anything bc hes been telling yall since week one but yall didnt listen #bb22
ive noticed that lube hasnt sold out anywhere clearly the panic buyers dont care about the people they are fucking over thats it thats my one #covid_19 joke sharing other people jokes and memes will resume shortly
were expecting word of a possible #brexit deal to emerge this morning a huge day in newsrooms around the world the latest on @bbcradiofoyle as things unfold this christmas eve
feeds are done for now who knows when they will return it might be 9pm et or 12am et or somewhere in between as far as anyone can tell janelle will still be voted out tonight and leave the #bb22 house unless they introduce the battle back she is likely going home
why should we do as every other nation does when weve proven in the past that we solve problems when we innovate american crises get solved by american ingenuity #demdebate
fair fucking play to preston they were tactically spot on we couldnt deal with their high press whatsoever i dont think we deserved a point at all we were awful #lufc
excellent ep today #gh i especially enjoyed watching the incomparable @c_shaughnessy share screen-time with the luminous @nancyleegrahn the gravitas the subtlety the sparks
one of the key points about #brexit that many fail to understand the had had disproportionate amount of influence in the which made it an attractive partner for those wishing to understand or influence the position
i wish it was as simple as you either pay njoku or you pay hooper but hooper is something like 11 mil of dead cap next season hoping the cap guys figure that out i dont want to lose njoku because of hooper dollars #browns
i mean if @brandiglanville was lying why would she be showing her phone to people shes super blunt and straightforward so im team brandi on this one #rhobh
#demdebate if you had billions of dollars would you still be a good candidate for the democrats would you still take money for your campaign or would you self fund the drive to be president
think im gonna take a break from feeds tonight and play some fucking skyrim theres only 6 people in there that are tolerable in that house rn everybody else bastards #bb22
#browns win 23-3 over the jets baker had what seemed like an off night and still threw for 325 obj for 161 and that long td chubb with a td next the rams on the triumphant return of sunday night football to cleveland
so kyle did not disappoint again whew chile its disappointing seeing her this season maybe she is starting menopause im not sure but this year is not a good look too old for that #rhobh
#demdebate dear moderators what policies are you going to bring to table in order to boost the economy in the rust belt states no one ever discusses the shuttered towns in ohio penn michigan wisconsin and wv you cant win the whitehouse without these states
so happy to see leeds utd back where they belong a great club with a great tradition and fans its been my pleasure to work for them over the years #lufc
bernie sanders just admitted that he wants a complete ban on fracking if bernie is the nominee he will lose pennsylvania -- thousands of natural gas jobs -- and trump will win #demdebate
#bb22 my fear and i think it is legit in todays climate when a poc gets nominated evicted many automatically blame racism so if i were a non-poc i would be scared to target a poc because social media would be ruthless but no one attacks a poc for who they target ever
no @ajrichardsonmp it is now obvious to everybody that #brexit doesnt have any benefits whatever your hopes were in 2016 if youre still clinging to the idea that there may be benefits one day youre either thick or mental wake up grow a spine tell the truth
i think if kaysar stays and janelle gets evicted production will find a way to bring back janelle with a twist they need the season to be interesting i would love to see the look on ratcoles face when janelle comes back into the house #bb22

so obviously feeds were not down because of technical issues they were down because production shut us out so we couldnt see the drama i wont pay for feeds in the future this shutting out defeats the whole purpose and makes all of us casuals #bb22
#brexit has split the country those who believe in the uk and the right to stand as a proud independent country in the world and those who want to hand control over to others so the uk is a mere token state in the eu the uk has a strong proud history one which i am proud of

ive watched 22 years of terrible browns football and that may have been the worst half ive ever seen if it wasnt for the offense on the first drive there wouldnt even be a maybe about it #browns
i need to spew some #browns thoughts high expectations werent fair & if they could get to 9-7 that should be a strong season coming off 7-9 & 1-31 i think the biggest downer is that the big expectations needed baker to take a leap forward but he did the opposite
id love some @nextgenstats about how fast myles garrett got to tannehill on that sack that had to be one of the fastest sacks where there was an attempted block all season #browns

the other ladies do their own makeup and some hair but ej still has her glam squad no shame no pity shes been acting since day 1 bet her & tom planned to have yolanda get her on the show thinking she could make $ to pay for his scams all a plan to scam #rhobh

my friend @donaldbkipkorir there is a growing consensus that the #brexit referendum was not well-thought out and was meant to quell a political rivalry at the time the public opinion is slowly shifting uk could have been wrong after all
#demdebate biden needs to also emphasize that he has good relationships with world leaders and can repair our reputation and alliances that trump has ripped up

the most important lesson the british political elite learned after suez 1956 was that britain was no longer a globe spanning empire and could not afford to act like one i wonder what theyll learn from #brexit whatever it is it is taking them far too long to learn

#lufc until saturday i thought eric dier was the only premier league player who was going to have to leave the pitch for following through this season

music to my ears i was concerned about stefanskis willingness and ability to go outside his scheme players like obj were not optimally utilized #browns
i think after covering the #browns for so many years it has made many reporters in cleveland cynical so now theyre willing to do whatever it takes for clicks and its created an alienation between them and the fanbase unfortunately

you guys who cares if tyler is on the block what we really need in order to have an interesting week is kevin winning that veto taking himself down and dare i say it enzo going up as a replacement lets talk about the chaos that would ensue then #bb22
all xmas did this week was make herself a target and get nicole dani enzo cody to not want to target her anymore day going far in this game lets fcken go #bb22
i think i may lose some fellow #lufc fans here but @jackgrealish would be a regular in most national sides in the world we have to find a way of getting him in the @englandteamrp on a regular basis
#btc starting to see some bullish arguments here if 4h and 8h closes higher like this it would make sense taking a long to range high or even higher bears are not winning this fight no evidence for further sell-off yet

#btc is indecisive btc is trying to pump up to the daily ema of 20 to flip resistance into support and yet previous daily dojis show exceptional market hesitation look out for long wicks and therefore continue to break
i dont blame any of them for supporting their other half but i would be so embarrassed if i were dom & vic danis microaggression & single white female obsession with janelle is cringe nicole fs whole personality & victim act is cringe swaggy winning across the board #bb22
is there anything that i can do with a dog who was clearly treated badly to make him more comfortable he loves my daughter that found him but socially distanced from the rest of us particularly untrusting of men #covid_19
#bb22 the only thing janelle is better than nicole at is comps nicole is smarter and more attractive yes even than 6 7 j nicole is better at big brother
honesty i think @mayorpete could beat trump in debates and maybe even the election but i dont think he is the big change president we need for a course correction from trump and failed neoliberalism #demdebate
lisa rinna and erika jayne created such a toxic environment on #rhobh and for its viewers and now this is where we are the housewives children are being attacked regularly
erika has the audacity to call garcelle a liar welp shes at least 2 of the thinks that kathy does not like a liar and a thief erika is the biggest liar in #rhobh history

the only good season of new school big brother is oh wait theyre are none because the people who deserved to win get robbed or dismissed and poc are targets and usually go out early thats why when i saw janelle kaysar keesha and one of the best new school players day #bb22
if you area good friend to someone you should admit when they are a dumb fuck kevin has been relatively awful towards janelle and its fair game for her to dislike him calling someone a preadator and making up preverse lies about them is not growth at all seems regressive #bb22

in his time in the nfl the #browns @bakermayfield is the 4th highest graded qb in the league when hes not playing in a game with obj yes since 2018 per @johnkosko3
think some people need to realize is that every head coach is at some point in time a first time head coach just because someone has had experience doesnt mean he was going to succeed #browns
there was already a shoulder head shoulder in #btc $btc graphics before elon tweets he clearly took advantage of this signal and then started fudding the market maybe institutions will embark on the dip maybe regulation come along

we note @andrewrawnsley makes no mention of the fact that remainer mps voted emphatically against staying in the single market and the most vociferous campaigners for eea efta were in fact leavers who understood those technical-sounding issues better than they did #brexit

@timharford its a cult of lying for effect with johnson he does it to wind up progressives and also galvanise his own supporters its a group cult identity thing worked on #brexit what really matters now is what middle england thinks which is shifting

at what point does this cross into the outbreak category of things though i get why last week wasnt postponed and dont really have an issue with it but now we seem to be in a different area #browns
i am so confused by this season of #rhobh so its ok for brandi to say she slept with a denise because it was told on camera but when denise brings up things said off camera its not ok
warrens rhetoric on billionaires and people who suck up to them was good but then she made a side swipe at sanders over support from pacs and tried to suggest the klobuchar was morally superior what the hell #demdebate

for all the talk of a revenge game against the #browns baker mayfield doesnt view it that way mayfield said hes grateful for the time he spent in cleveland but playing against guys youre familiar with does make it more interesting and fun

gotta take it for what it is this is a championship team that have had a good go 60 million pounds worth of players missing tonight staggering really #lufc
as expected its mostly just been a back and forth of orange man bad the only candidate that seems to be putting in any effort is poor ol petey #demdebate
here we go #lufc remember one game doesnt define a season lets enjoy football being back and get behind the team as always just need to survive again for me
die hard fans go on twitter to unload irrational fandom its that never say die attitude hence the name die hard fans the last thing #browns fans want to see is the national & local media dancing on our grave again
nope #btc is either money or nothing its definitely not a commodity as commodities have lots of use casea in real world their price change affects price of thousands of other products altcoins are tech stock

i dont care that the browns won this game the offensive still looks as bad as it did 2 weeks ago and they scored 0 points in the second half the defensive is carrying this team and you cant beat good teams playing like this if lamar didnt get knocked out thats a l #browns

bloomberg paid hundreds of millions of dollars to be publicly humiliated on national television though the jokes on all of us because hes actually polling quite well #demdebate

#rhobh thats so funny how @erikajayne said tom would be cussed out if he spoke to girls like that yah right i remember he reprimanded u when ur girls acted out of place u would nvr cuss your atm out like that
this #demdebate is an absolute shit show the field is in shambles and the party is incredibly fractured hard to see how they get this train back on the tracks by november
i know its probably a long shot but i wish memphis would actually listen and work with janelle and kaysar and i understand why theyre telling him bc hes in power but like damn i hope they dont reveal too much bc he will tell his side #bb22
i was hoping that tyler was gonna win out till the end but now i was mistaken thats what cody is doing the one person that is safe with the house also thinks he has to win his way to the end the odds seem to working in the new jersey kids favor #bb22

easy to forget how many incredible goals hes scored for us the sheer variety of dizzyingly good finishes is the thing that gets me seems unfair that were currently missing yet more of this #lufc

the nonsense spouted by the fundamentalists over the weekend that a no deal is better than a bad deal misses that there is no good #brexit but theres a golden opportunity to limit the worst of the inevitable damage

love listening to these mps talking rubbish on #brexit @labour on @gmb saying many people want to remain just wondering if he remembers the vote by the uk population maybe he cant after all it was 3 5 years ago

#demdebate it sounds like elisabeth warren will order the fed to create 200 trillion dollars so she can spend it all why tax and spend when you can just print more
born in the early 60s but love #lufc some younger fans seem to get a delight in my not being the greatest spelling person in the world but there you go

#rhobh anybody else telling these stories that erika is telling specially the changing stories would get attacked with questions and accused of lying it happened to lvp & denise but this time it happens for one of the mean girl group the dirt they must have on each other
#brexit timeline 2016 brexit will make us better off 2017 brexit wont make us worse off 2018 brexit will make us worse off but only for 1st 50 years 2019 nobody ever claimed it would make us better off 2020 we dont care if we starve 2021 its all remainers fault
if someone has a sound reasoned factual basis for their opinions theyll deploy those facts to persuade you to agree with them if instead they use lies distortions & misrepresentations you can be sure their opinions are worthless or their intentions malign #brexit

#rhobh this week was intense you can just feel the storm @erikajayne has brewing inside her she had to leave i believe her and all of this falling back on her is exactly what she was anticipating
as much as we hope erika will end up in a one bedroom back in georgia its unlikely its clear her immediate circle doesnt connect her possessions with blood money so shell always have some upper class level of support #rhobh

noticing how @cbsbigbrother showcased every alliance tonight except for derricks the core 4 led by his boy cody which included nicole dani and enzo every alliance in that house had the majority of the core 4 in it dani was the only casualty #bb22
this pump and dump on #btc due to cpi data will be temporary market will back on track after 12h i m considering this news as a noise do follow @israr_ahmad___
4% majority is not a mandate for a hard #brexit and theres the rub in this whole thing @conservatives lunging on ahead knowing that it will cause economic hardship for years smacks irresponsibility imv it has rightly been challenged by the 48% @peoplesvote_uk @libdems
#browns qb baker mayfield on kevin stefanski as a play-caller smooth operator right now were continuing to call things that are working until teams can prove they can stop it were going to pound the rock create matchups on the outside and take advantage of that
a few days ago day ran off from a convo with ian saying she had a good line for the dr and she wanted to get in and say it before she forgot it again i have a feeling that her line that ended the episode was that line #bb22
im not going to say i told you so that i called #bb22 being an all-star season back in january february before the pandemic even hit based on the strange time line of this years casting process and lack of open call postings compared to last year but iykyk and i told you so
to say something nice about another candidate julian castro brought up an excellent point that you cant address gun violence without also addressing police violence and that disarming the police has to be part of any disarming of the public of military weapons #demdebate

i still dont understand why erika hates lvp so much she really hates her guts its weird every single one of those ladies are manipulative including her its the name of the game what am i missing here #rhobh

i think sutton was mad at kathy for calling her thomasina but she knows she cant attack her so she went after crystal again and all of the other ladies enable her #rhobh
im thinking since crystal had an eating disorder maybe shes still kinda insecure about herself because to me its not a big deal also great episode tonight from beginning to the end #rhobh
i havent watched one episode of rhobh i have read the comments whoever sutton is shes got to have a million times more personality than john mellencamps shadow and her eddie meunster look-alike husband #rhobh @teddimellencamp

well my thoughts from this mornings game adams and roca as a partnership both strong in tackles and press well together pat is getting there aaronson looked good in moments as did rasmus second half we looked very disjointed tho john mcginn is a prick #lufc
idc what anyone says id trade a 10 for adams and we can work to trade back up into the first or work another free agent trade for a tackle i hope adams is in orange and brown next season nonetheless #browns

losing a game is very tough on fans football is emotional+i think its pretty stupid to tell other people how to react to it if youre angry sad negative positive whatever its not wrong and were all always there at the next game singing ups + downs #lufc

the mess bielsa has made at #lufc just out the transfer window and not fixed a thing from a fake season his own training strikes again not a other manager in the league with his injuries to his own players
perhaps just one of the many various & different reasons why many people in the u k got tired of those people over in belgium telling us what to do etc ergo #brexit good luck with your own plan @alexanderdecroo maybe stick to making chocolates & beer next time

if it isnt russ we need to run it back with baker and draft a qb we arent beating these teams with jimmy g carr or kirk you need an elite qb in this afc to get to the sb either we find out in year 5 baker can be that or the guy we draft in the 2nd hopefully is #browns

one day the british public will wake up to the simple truth that #brexit wasnt good for anybody except for a very wealthy business elite who wanted fewer regulations a laisser-faire small state and the freedom to protect their wealth from taxes
candidates screaming about how expensive medicare for all would be arent talking about how partial buy in medicare is a terrible more costly to those who choose private & unsustainable option its gotta be all in #demdebate
#browns fans our team had a great season and went toe to toe with the class of the nfl the best is yet to come so with that in mind try not to get baited by a coked up johnny manziel tonight
so im kinda confused as to whats happening on #brexit apparently boris johnson made a plan to leave the un by october 31st but parliament rejected it which means what exactly does the un stay in the eu untill they can agree on a leave date or does all hell break loose
whoever voted for this absolute shitshow of a government should hang their heads in shame 60 000 excess deaths worst impending recession due to covid and striving gleefully for a no deal precipice #brexit why not just shoot us
dear lord pls let release the hatred from davonnes heart and give her the patience to have a convo w david lord please allow them to make up forgive each other & figure out it was nicole amen #bb22

myles garrett should be suspended for ten games at no point of the game should you go after the quarterback mason rudolph got hit with a helmet not a fist garrett is a pussy and im happy that pouncey punched and kicked the shit out of him fuck the whole #browns organization
the #brexit negotiations remind me of a disorganised uni student not doing any work for 3 years leaving their dissertation until the week before pulling an all nighter & being upset about their final grade blaming everyone else for it and everyone hates millennials right
the calls by young people to remove the democractic right of voting for people over 70 years of age is a constitutional outrage #brexit @toadmeister @fox_claire

this is brilliant there are many decent @conservatives out there of course there are some pretty horrid ones too but all that matters right now is that @borisjohnson is winning hearts this is crucial if were to make a success of #brexit its crucial for our future
22 passes in the first half and only 9 rushes stefanski is aware that chubb and hunt are playing today correct also we had 3 defensive turnovers that amounted to a total of 3 points gross this offense is so bad and they play calling matches it #browns

if any #brexit voters thinks weve seen the last of the eu27 youre sorely mistaken we will need to meet with them and keep aligned in everything we do for the rest of time until we rejoin and the side effect of brexit is that our vote will no oongest exist

at the end of the day the loss isnt on chubb scoring a touchdown or cade missing a pointless xp at the time its on joe woods calling really bad defenses and delpit not knowing his assignment on multiple plays this loss is on the #browns defense not the offense

i dont think that is true overall the playcalling has been fine save maybe this past week a lot of execution and effort issues early from wrs and others not playing up to potential and injuries are a far bigger issue on offense not the play calling #browns
i wonder if raph and phillips are looking at the players coming in and thinking fuck me somethings happening here fuck sitting on the bench at city #lufc
i disagree that this was a smart move it was literally dumb considering almost everyone in his alliance played i understand the benefits but next week if janelle wins hoh so many people on that other side can be put up #bb22
what a great season by the #browns im so proud of that team and what they were able to accomplish they fought through so much adversity and i think its safe to say we have our franchise qb
leeds have drawn at home to a team that lost 5-2 last week can the english media calm down please they are good but not as good as people are making out #lufc
i love how curtis and jason are explaining everything to cam and trina itll help make sure they understand their job is to stay safe and out of the way and i really love them teaming up #gh

im seeing a lot of people saying that the browns need the titans to lose out if im correct that is not the case if titans and steelers lose 2 and the browns win out then there will be a 3 way tie at 9-7 tiebreaker would then be conference record which would be browns #browns

all coronavirus has done to our country is show how selfish and heartless our people are the government cares more about money than our health companys dont value there employees at all and that our emergency staff should be valued way more highly honestly a joke #covid_19

let s just say it as it is there are some good bits about the eu and some bad bits whats matters to people is what bits they care about the most to me the important bit is that leaving without a deal carries risks which i dont think are worth the potential benefits #brexit

in terms of #brexit deadline which was the weekend and then became monday it sounds as though everything could go to the wire there is still no european council agenda which will set out timings and therefore indicate whether were talking deal extension no deal
the problem is with #brexit nobody on the leave side actually bothered to read it always was economical suicide the writing was always on the wall this is what happens when you only read headlines
